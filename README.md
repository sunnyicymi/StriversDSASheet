# Begineer friendly Striver's DSA Sheet Solution with though process in Java

**Introduction:**
My nams is Sunny Kumar and I am a Full-Stack developer with almost 3 Years of experience of working in startup companies and I'll would like to tell you that I am really good with the development related work but similarly bad at DSA problems.

I never focused on DSA before but I wanted to switch to even a better place, DSA is a thing which I need to learn atleast.


**Planning:**
I am planning to finish all 455 topics within 90 days of time span hence I need to cover atleast 7 topics each day without any break and this is going to be my challenge. You can adjust acccording to your availability, pacing and understanding of topics.


**Structure:**
I am going to make branch day wise. Means whatever I do for the day will go into a specific branch and main branch will be collection of everything.

table

| #  | Topic              | Link                                                   |
|----|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | User Input/Output  | [Code](https://github.com/sunnyicymi/StriversDSASheet/day1/code1.md) |

<table style="width:100vw !important">

    <tr>
      <th style="width:5%">#</th>
      <th style="width:25%">Topic</th>
      <th style="width:70%">Link</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
