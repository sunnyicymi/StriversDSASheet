## 👋 Introduction

Hi, I’m **Sunny Kumar** – a passionate Full-Stack Developer with nearly **3 years of experience** working in fast-paced startups. I'm confident when it comes to development, but when it comes to **DSA**, I've always struggled. 🧠💥

Until now.

I’ve decided it’s time to face this head-on and strengthen my fundamentals. My goal is simple: become as confident with **problem-solving** as I am with **shipping production code**.
